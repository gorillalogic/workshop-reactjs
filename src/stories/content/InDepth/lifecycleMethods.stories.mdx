# Lifecycle Methods

There are two main ways of defining components in Reac, using a function or defining a class that extends from React.Component.

## Function Component

As the name suggests, a function component is a `JavaScript` function, this function receives as parameter a `props` object that
contains `{key:value}` pairs with information passed from outside the component. 

The function also returns a root React Element that can contain `n` children React Elements. These elements are a description of how the Component UI should look like.

The main difference with a Class Component is that we have easy access to a `local state` managed by the component and to the lifecycle methods. We'll dig deeper into these subjects later.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function SimpleComponent(props) {
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Hello there!</h1>
            <p>I'm a simple ReactJS Component that renders a title with a paragraph.</p>
        </div>
    );
}

export default SimpleComponent;
```

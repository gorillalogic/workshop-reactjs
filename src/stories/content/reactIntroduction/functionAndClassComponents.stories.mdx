# Function and Class Components

There are two main ways of defining components in Reac, using a function or defining a class that extends from React.Component.

## Function Component

As the name suggests, a function component is a `JavaScript` function, this function receives as parameter a `props` object that
contains `{key:value}` pairs with information passed from outside the component. 

The function also returns a root React Element that can contain `n` children React Elements. These elements are a description of how the Component UI should look like.

The main difference with a Class Component is that we have easy access to a `local state` managed by the component and to the lifecycle methods. We'll dig deeper into these subjects later.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function SimpleComponent(props) {
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Hello there!</h1>
            <p>I'm a simple ReactJS Component that renders a title with a paragraph.</p>
        </div>
    );
}

export default SimpleComponent;
```

## Class Components

A class component is a little more complex than a function component in the sense that it requires a bit more of code in order to be defined.

In this case we will have an ES6+ Class that will extend from the `React.Component` object. Additional to that, there will be a `render()` class function, 
this function unlike the one from `Funtion Components` doesn't receive any parameters, but it does return a React Element.


```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import styled from 'styled-components';

const Container = styled.div`
  border: 1px solid #333;
  background-color: #666;
  padding: 2em;
`;

const Title = styled.h1`
  color: #1EA7FD;
  font-weight: bold;
`;

export default class ClassComponent extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <Container>
        <Title>I'm a Class Component</Title>
      </Container>
    );
  }
}
```
